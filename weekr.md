# Final N@TM Individual Review Tickets

[Team Screwdrivers Scrumboard](https://github.com/NoahJ214/Team-Screwdrivers/projects/1)

Sponsor Assessment: Our sponsor liked our project, and he said that it is a useful tool that the club can use in the future. He especially liked the roster and hours feature, since it makes it really easy to log hours and keep track of who is in the club. It also allows people to join the club on their own, simply by making an account and registering themselves into the database. 

Team Assessment: 33/35 - Our group worked well together during the period before and after AP Exames. We collaborated in class and solved problems within our code and Github. Our website was very visually appealing and had a lot of features, meeting all of the database requirements with our Roster and Hours page. Our main issue was working on deployment, as we had many issues and had to work together to try and resolve the problems. Overall, our team was collaborative and focused during class and our PBL meets all of the requirements for the N@TM.
