Self Grade Assessment: 2.2/2.5 - I made contributions to the PBL with a photo gallery and part of the calendar, as well as small visual details to make the page look better. I also created the Homepage and Roster wireframes for our group, as well as setup and maintained our team Github Pages. Finally, I edited our final N@TM commercial video.

Team Grade Assessment: 2.3/2.5 - Our group worked well together during the period before and after AP Exames. We collaborated in class and solved problems within our code and Github. Our website was very visually appealing and had a lot of features, meeting all of the database requirements with our Roster and Hours page. Our main issue was working on deployment, as we had many issues and had to work together to try and resolve the problems. Overall, our team was collaborative and focused during class and our PBL meets all of the requirements for the N@TM.
